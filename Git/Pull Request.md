#### Overview
- In a pull request, collaborators can review and discuss the proposed set of changes before they integrate the changes into the main codebase.

#### Different from `git pull`
- This is entirely different from running a `git pull` command on your local machine, in which you're incorporating changes from a remote repository into your current branch.

#### Background
- Normally when working on a project, you create a branch for the issue your working on and make your changes on that branch.
- When completed, you need to merge that branch back into the main development branch or main branch. 
- To do that you raise a Pull request which will "pull" your changes from your branch into the main branch.
