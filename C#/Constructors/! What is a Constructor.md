- Whenever an instance of a class or a struct is created, its constructor is called. 
- Constructors have the same name as the class or struct.
- A class or struct may have multiple constructors that take different arguments. 
- Constructors enable the programmer to set default values, limit instantiation, and write code that is flexible and easy to read.
