#### Comparing Collections
- Using the **ExceptWith** and **Union** methods we can perform comparisons like:
	- What suppliers sell same products
		- Union
	- Products you sell that other suppliers don't
		- ExceptWith

#### Removing Duplicates
- You can add another collection to a HashSet that has duplicate items and the duplicates will be removed.

#### Existence Check
- Probably the most common use for HashSets is to see whether they contain a certain element, which is close to an O(1) operation for them (as opposed to lists which is O(n).
- A good example [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1249578) where a guy used a HashSet to store a fixed collection of illegal commands. This HashSet was then checked against whenever a command was parsed.
