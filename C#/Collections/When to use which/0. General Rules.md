- **Array** need to use:
    - So often as possible. It's fast and takes smallest RAM range for same amount information.
    - If you know exact count of cells needed
    - If data saved in array < 85000 b (85000/32 = 2656 elements for integer data)
    - If needed high Random Access speed
- **List** need to use:
    - If needed to add cells to the end of list (often)
    - If needed to add cells in the beginning/middle of the list (NOT OFTEN)
    - If data saved in array < 85000 b (85000/32 = 2656 elements for integer data)
    - If needed high Random Access speed
- **LinkedList** need to use:
    - If needed to add cells in the beginning/middle/end of the list (often)
    - If needed only sequential access (forward/backward)
    - If you need to save LARGE items AND items count is low.
    - Better do not use for large amount of items, as it's use additional memory for links.
