- Indexers allow instances of a class or struct to be indexed just like arrays. 
- The indexed value can be set or retrieved without explicitly specifying a type or instance member.
- Indexers do not have to be indexed by an integer value; it is up to you how to define the specific look-up mechanism.
- Applicable on both classes and structs.
