- To process online transactions, you need both a [[payment gateway]] and a [[payment processor]].
- The gateway securely captures and transmits the customers card payment information to the processor which then actually processes the transaction. 
- Funds from the customers bank are then temporarily routed to a merchant account (known as an [[Aggregated Account]]). 
- The payment is then routed to the merchants actual bank account.
- Stripe provides both gateway and processor functionality making it a convenient way to handle e-commerce (although not always the cheapest).

- Stripes payment processor solution is called [[Stripe Payments]]
