### Overview
- A payment service provider, or PSP, is a third-party company that lets businesses securely accept credit card, debit card and digital wallet payments online and in person without having to open a dedicated [[merchant account]].
- This means businesses can begin accepting payments almost immediately, as opposed to having to go through a long application process, and can often avoid monthly subscription fees.
- Stripe and PayPal are examples of PSPs.

### PSP vs Dedicated Merchant Account Providers
- PSPs and dedicated merchant account providers both make it possible for businesses to accept payments. 
- The biggest difference is that payment service providers pool multiple businesses under a single merchant account (known as an [[Aggregated Account]]) whereas dedicated merchant account providers designate a separate account.
- Because merchant account providers give each business its own separate account, it can take weeks to get approved to start accepting card payments.
