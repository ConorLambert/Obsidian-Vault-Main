### Overview
- A payment gateway is a technology or service that securely transmits payment information between the customer, the business, and the payment processor. 
- It acts as a bridge between the parties involved in a transaction, enabling the exchange of information required for processing payments. 
- A payment gateway is the digital equivalent of a [[Point of Sale System|point-of-sale (POS)]] terminal found in physical retail shops.
- *Using a payment gateway ensures that sensitive payment information is handled securely.*
