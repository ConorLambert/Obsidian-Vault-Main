- When customers check out online, walk up to your checkout counter, or pick out an item from your stand or booth, theyâ€™re at the point of sale (or point of purchase). 
- Your point-of-sale system is the hardware and software that enable your business to make those sales:
	- Barcode scanners
	- Cash Registers
	- Card Readers
	- Mobile App
- Some examples:
	- In a store, your POS could be the cash register (for cash payments) and/or a card reader where you ring up customers and accept payments.
	- If you operate a food truck, a phone or tablet could be all you need to process orders and is there your POS.
- A POS system allows your business to accept payments from customers and keep track of sales.
