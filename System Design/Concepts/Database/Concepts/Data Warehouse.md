- Data warehouses are central repositories of integrated data from one or more disparate sources. 
- They store current and historical data in one single place that are used for creating reports. 
- This is beneficial for companies as it enables them to interrogate and draw insights from their data and make decisions.
- The data stored in the warehouse is uploaded from the operational systems (such as marketing or sales). 
- The data may pass through an operational data store and may require data cleansing for additional operations to ensure data quality before it is used in the data warehouse for reporting.
