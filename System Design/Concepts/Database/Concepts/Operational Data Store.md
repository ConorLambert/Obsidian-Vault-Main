- An operational data store (ODS) is used for [operational reporting](https://www.jaspersoft.com/articles/what-is-operational-reporting#:~:text=Operational%20reporting%20is%20the%20process,and%20comprehensive%20examinations%20of%20processes.) and as a source of data for the enterprise [[Data Warehouse]] (EDW). 
- It is a complementary element to an EDW in a decision support environment, and is used for operational reporting, controls, and decision making, as opposed to the EDW, which is used for tactical and strategic decision support.
- An ODS doesn't require the same kind of transformations. Instead, data remains in its existing schema. In this sense, ODS is more like a [[Data Lake]], although an ODS is much smaller than a data lake and can only store structured data.
