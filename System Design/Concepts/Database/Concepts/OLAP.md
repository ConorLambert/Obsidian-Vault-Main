- Online analytical processing (OLAP) is software technology you can use to analyse business data from different points of view. 
- Organisations collect and store data from multiple data sources, such as websites, applications, smart meters, and internal systems.
- Useful for generating reports, perform complex data analysis, and identify trends.
- Online Analytical Processing is an analytical activity like count, aggregation, mean, sum, etc., generally performed on databases that have been de-normalised to facilitate OLAP.
- These de-normalised databases are often referred to as [[Data Warehouse]]s.
