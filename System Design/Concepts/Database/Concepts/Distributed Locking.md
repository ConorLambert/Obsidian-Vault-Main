- Distributed locking is a method used to prevent multiple nodes from reading and writing to the same resource simultaneously. 
- Before a node starts to perform an operation, it attempts to acquire a lock. If the lock acquisition is successful, the node can safely perform the operation knowing no other node will interfere. Once itâ€™s done, it releases the lock, allowing other nodes to acquire it.
