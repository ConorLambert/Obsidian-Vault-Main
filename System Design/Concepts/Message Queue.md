## Overview
- Storage mechanism used by a [[Message Broker]]
- A compute resource sends messages to a message queue and forgets about them. 
- On the other end, a pool of workers (also compute resources) processes the messages at their own pace. 
- Messages can be anything from a simple string to a complex object.
- Used synonymously with [[Message Broker]].
