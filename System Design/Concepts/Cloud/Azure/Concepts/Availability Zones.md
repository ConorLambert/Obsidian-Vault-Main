- Many Azure regions provide availability zones, which are separated groups of datacenters within a region. 
- Availability zones are close enough to have low-latency connections to other availability zones. 
- However, availability zones are far enough apart to reduce the likelihood that more than one will be affected by local outages or weather. 
- Availability zones have independent power, cooling, and networking infrastructure. 
- They're designed so that if one zone experiences an outage, then regional services, capacity, and high availability are supported by the remaining zones. 
- They help your data stay synchronised and accessible when things go wrong.
