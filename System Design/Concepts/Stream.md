Really good overview and examples in that source.

### Overview
- Streaming is the continuous transfer of data where data can be processed as it comes in. 
- Streaming platforms allow for **real-time** data processing, allowing immediate insights and actions based on the incoming data.
- Often used for processing large amounts of fast-moving data.

### Use Cases
- Designed for **real-time** data processing and analytics.
- Perfect for scenarios where time-sensitive actions are necessary, like real-time **fraud detection** or live **dash-boarding**.
- Sensor data about the environment that you must continuously collect and process to observe real-time changes in temperature or air pressure.

### Technologies
- [[Apache Kafka]]
