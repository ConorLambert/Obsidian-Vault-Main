A Singleton class in C#, at its core, is made up of three main components:
- Private constructor.
- Private static instance of the class itself.
- Public static method that returns the instance of the class.

```
public sealed class Singleton  
{  
	private static Singleton instance = null; // Private Instance  
	private Singleton() {} // Private Constructor  
  
	public static Singleton Instance // Public Method  
	{  
		get
		{  
			if (instance == null)  
			{  
				instance = new Singleton();  
			}  
			return instance;  
		}  
	}  
}
```

The null is initially assigned to the instance. When the `Instance` method is called for the very first time, it creates a new Singleton object.
