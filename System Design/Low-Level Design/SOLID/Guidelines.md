- PDD (Pain Driven Development)
	- Write using the simplest code you know to get the problem solved
	- Don't worry about SOLID
		- ==Trying to apply all the SOLID principles up front is a form of [[Premature Optimisation]]==
	- As your application grows, look for places where the application is painful to work with
		- Difficultly with testing 
		- Excess duplication
		- Too much coupling
	- ==When you feel that pain, see if any of the SOLID principles can be applied.==
