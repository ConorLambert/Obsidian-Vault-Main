- Each software module should have one and only one reason to change.

#### What is a Responsibility
- It's a decision our code is making about the specific implementation details of some part of what the application does.
- It's the answer to the question of how something is done
- Some examples of responsibility:
	- Persistence
		- Is the class using files, database, Web API?
	- Logging 
		- Is there a particular framework being used
	- Validation
		- How is input to the system validated 
	- Business Logic
- Mixed into the above are the business rules that define how the system should behave from the stakeholders perspective.
	- They don't care about the low level details of how files are stored or logs are written but they care that the system models the business problem effectively.
- *A responsibility in your code represent things that may change at different times and for different reasons.*
- Each responsibility is an **axes of change**
- The potential sources of changes to your application can help identify when you might be violating SRP
- Think about where change requests may originate in terms of different executives within a large company:
	- **CIO/CTO** may require a change to persistence because of a company wide change in database vendors
	- **Security Officer** may require a more robust logging framework installed to help detect and protect against attackers 
	- **COO** requires update to validation rules to integrate effectively with the companies newly acquired subsidiary.
	- **Marketing** announced a special offering and now the price calculations that your business rules model need to account for this new offer.
