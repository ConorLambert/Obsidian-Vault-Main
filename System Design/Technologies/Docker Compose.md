### Overview
- Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications.
- Compose simplifies the control of your entire application stack, making it easy to manage services, networks, and volumes in a single, comprehensible YAML configuration file. 
- Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration file.

### Background
- Think of the situation where you have a multi-container application where the web app is in one container and the database is another container. 
- You would have to start and stop each container manually when running the application.
- Docker Compose solves this problem
