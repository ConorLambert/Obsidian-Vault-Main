Very detailed explanation
### Overview
- Elastic Container Service
- `ECS` is a logical grouping of [[AWS EC2|EC2]] machines/instances. 
- Technically speaking `ECS` is a mere configuration for an efficient use and management of your [[AWS EC2|EC2]] instance(s) resources i.e. storage, memory, CPU, etc.
- `ECS` makes sense only once one (or more) [[AWS EC2|EC2]] instances are added to it.
- `ECS` is about the clustering of [[AWS EC2|EC2]] instances, and uses **Docker** to instantiate containers/instances/virtual machines on these [[AWS EC2|EC2]] hosts.
