- *Don’t give estimates based on everything working out perfectly. Plan for failure - yours and everyone else’s.*
- Split task to smallest possible chunks and estimate each chunk. 
- If you have no idea how long this one chunks takes - mark it as "need investigation" and don't forget to mention in estimations.
- Ask your pm for examples of previous estimates for something similar to use as a template/example.
- Give estimates in broad time categories: "Days", "Weeks", "Months".
- Overestimation is your friend. Avoid destroying users trust in a bad product.
