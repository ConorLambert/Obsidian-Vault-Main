## Background
- In order to comply with [[! Terminology#regulatory|regulatory]] Solvency II reporting and [[! Terminology#Statutory|statutory]] IFRS returns, a non-unit reserve needs to be calculated. 
- A non-unit reserve is the amount of money the company needs to hold in order to ensure we can meet all future policyholder liabilities.
- This calculation is completed by the actuarial reporting team and is a 60 year stochastic cashflow projection of all policies, taking account of all future fees/charges and claims. This projection uses policyholder and market data and takes account of future assumptions relating to lapses, mortality, expenses etc, as well as future economic assumptions.

## Solution
- Developed an actuarial modelling solution called **ARCSim** (Athora Risk and Capital Simulator)

### Prophet
- An application called Prophet was used beforehand but this was slow and not very customisable
