### Statutory
- Required by law and refer to current laws that were passed by a state or federal government.
- These laws are generally static and rarely change unless a new law is passed that updates it.

### Regulatory
- Proxy legal requirements
- Required by law but refer to rules issued by a regulating body that is appointed by a state or federal government.
- These are legal requirements through proxy, where the regulating body is the source of the requirement. 
- It is important to keep in mind that regulatory requirements tend to change more often than statutory requirements.

### Assumptions
[ChatGPT Source](https://chatgpt.com/c/c498b8d3-58b5-4db0-a708-17f1faa7138c)
- Actuarial models are used to project future events or financial results *based on uncertain factors*.
- Assumptions are critical inputs that represent the estimated values or behaviours of various factors influencing the financial outcomes of an insurance policy, pension plan, or other financial products
- An example of an assumption is Mortality Rates i.e. the likelihood of death at each age of a given population.
- Actuaries use their expertise to set these assumptions based on historical data, industry standards, regulatory requirements, and professional judgment. 
- Regular monitoring and adjustment are essential to ensure that the assumptions remain relevant and accurate.

### Output Variables
[ChatGPT Source](https://chatgpt.com/c/b3a01b4c-4328-45b4-a7d2-17635d5f6076) 
- Output variables are the results generated by the model after processing the input data and applying the specified assumptions, formulas, and algorithms. 
- These variables represent the key metrics that actuaries use to analyse and assess the financial or insurance-related scenarios being modelled.
- These output variables are critical for decision-making in insurance, pensions, and financial risk management. Actuaries use them to evaluate the adequacy of reserves, determine pricing, assess profitability, and ensure regulatory compliance.

### Temporal(Pre/Post) Calculations
[ChatGPT Source](https://chatgpt.com/c/ec3705de-2765-4525-ae48-5c008ebbcd12)
- **Temporal**
	- Time-based projections which is the main part of the projection.
- **Pre-temporal**
	- Calculations performed before the main temporal (time-based) analysis in a model.
	- These calculations could involve setting up initial conditions, assumptions, or other preparatory steps that need to be completed before time-based projections or analyses begin. Some examples of preparatory steps are:
		- Grouping or segmenting data by certain characteristics (e.g., age, gender, policy type)
		- Calculate initial reserves or liabilities before projecting these values over time
- **Post-temporal**
	- Calculations or adjustments made after the main time-based (temporal) analysis has been completed. 
	- These calculations typically involve summarising, refining, or interpreting the results generated by the temporal model to provide actionable insights or to meet specific reporting or regulatory requirements. Some examples are:
		- Aggregate or summarised.
		- Discounting future amounts back to present value using some discount rate.
		- Reconciling the results with prior periods

### Shocks
- Shocks are a critical tool in actuarial modelling used to test and analyse how extreme conditions impact the financial health and stability of an organisation
- Purpose of applying shocks
	- Evaluate how the companies financial positions would perform under adverse conditions
	- Find areas where the company might be particularly vulnerable.
	- Explore different hypothetical scenarios to see how various shocks could impact outcomes
	- Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements that often include stress testing and shock analysis as part of solvency assessments.
- ME: Remember each run used one of the four ESG scenarios (SF_UP, SF_DOWN, SPREAD)
- ME: Remember the reporting guys ran different shocks like SF_UP ("interestrateup") and SF_DOWN ("interestratedown") and many others each within their own run group. They updated the SF_UP, etc files for each run group to have different values.

### Model Point
[Chat GPT Source](https://chatgpt.com/c/4864abcc-8114-4226-985e-55be04eec878)
- Model points in actuarial modelling are representative data points or sets of data used to model and analyze the behavior of a larger population or portfolio.
- These points simplify the complex real-world situation by grouping similar risks or policies together, allowing actuaries to perform calculations more efficiently.
- Each model point represents a group of similar individuals, policies, or contracts. For instance, in life insurance, a model point might represent all policies issued to males aged 30-35 with similar policy features (like sum assured, premium term, etc.)
- By using model points, actuaries reduce the number of calculations required. Instead of running a model for each individual policy or member, they can run it for a smaller number of representative model points, significantly speeding up the process.
- Model points aggregate the characteristics of many individual policies or members into a single point, which can be used in projections, valuations, and scenario testing.

### ESG
- ???
- ME: Create a scenario based on some shock (SF_UP, SF_DOWN, SPREAD, etc)
- This formed part of the input into the Run Projection.

### Stochastic Cash Flow
- A stochastic cash flow refers to a cash flow that is uncertain or random and is modelled using probability distributions.
- Incorporates variability due to uncertain factors like fluctuating interest rates, stock prices, inflation, and other external influences.




 Actuarial Projection: Cashflow projection into the future, allowing for uncertainty in future
assumptions and economic conditions
 VA: Variable annuity is a contract which provides a guaranteed level of income for life, whilst
allowing upside investment potential. There are optional guaranteed death benefits and the
option to surrender
 Unit-Linked: A policy where the benefits are linked directly to the investment performance
of a specified fund, and characterised by a lower level of guarantees on benefits and
premiums
 Non-Linked: Non-linked products are conventional products – whereby a sum of money is
invested and the company provides some insurance/assurance (term assurance, health
insurance etc). Investor has no sight of the investment strategy of the company, and all
investment risk lies with the company.
 With Profits: A With Profit investment builds value through bonuses paid by the company.
Bonuses are not guaranteed but once declared cannot be removed. Bonuses are declared
based on the performance of the whole With Profits fund.
 ESG: Economic Scenario Generators are tools which produce forward looking scenarios for
various economic risk factors (simulates future economic paths).
