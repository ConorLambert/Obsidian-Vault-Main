## Questions
- Why was project outsourced?
	- ==Conflict between the actuaries on both sides==
	- We took on many business units which was totally unforeseen.
	- BUs weren't properly explaining how their processes worked. A lot of rift between them during handover phase.
	- Our platform didnt fit in with their process and we would have to knock it down and start again to accommodate it.
	- When we got to Belgium, there whole process was different and didnt really fit in. Same with Netherlands. We were confident after Germany because that worked.
	- *There was a clash between our processed and how their process and what information they wanted out of it, we didnt provide or couldnt provide.*
- NOTE:
	- If don't know something say you can't remember because it's been so long.
