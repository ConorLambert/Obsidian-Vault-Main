- Why SharePoint
	- Company wide use
	- All data and files stored there
	- Reporting team where use to it
	- Reporting mostly used files
		- They had their own validation process amongst themselves
		- We had offered to translate everything into form based input.
- API
	- SharePoint API
		- How did it work (HTTP, async, etc)
- How it worked/interacted
	- Template folder with all possible inputs files correctly named
	- User creates new run group, duplicates the template folder. User would then overwrite each file.
	- Mostly used duplicate feature which would duplicate existing folder (not the template folder).
	- User clicks icon on front-end for an input where the sub-folder of where that input file is stored is opened.
- .NET Modules installed (on server)
	- ???
- Issues
	- Firewall/port number setting
	- Throttling
		- Only certain number of requests per second.
