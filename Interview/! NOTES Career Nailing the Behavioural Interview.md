# Introduction to Behavioural Interviews
### What are they and why do they matter ?
- Interviews will ask a probing question and then keep asking follow up questions that go deeper into your previous answer.

### Key competencies
- When talking about leadership, they mean influencing and guiding others towards achieving a goal, regardless of title.
	- Companies want people who can inspire, mentor and elevate their peers.

# Preparing for the Interview
### Crafting good stories
- STAR Framework
	- Situation
		- Set the scene
	- Task
		- Specific challenge, responsibility you had to take
	- Action
		- What action did you take or contribute to overcome the situation
		- Show off here
	- Result
		- What happened as a result ? Did it fail, was it a success ?
		- Be honest and vulnerable.
- Don't obsess or lean too much into STAR framework. 
	- Can get lost in the detail and lose the emotion
- Focus on the emotional and how you grew.
- How did it impact and relate it back to the companies roles.
- Don't give too much detail. The interview will ask for more detail if they need to.
- Try not to sound too rehearsed. Can come off as fake.
- Record yourself doing an interview
