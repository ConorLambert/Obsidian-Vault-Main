# Reflection
#### Triangle
- To create the triangular part of the message box, create a triangular div using the `border` property.
	- Follow this [tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/css-triangle/) on how to do this (check the CodePen for a very good illustration)
#### Absolute positioning
- Use `position: absolute` along with the `top`/`left`/`bottom` properties to position things like the message box, triangular shape and storage displays.
- Don't forget to put `position: relative` on ancestor element.
