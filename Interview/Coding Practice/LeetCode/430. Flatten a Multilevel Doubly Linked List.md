## My Solution
[Submission](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-a-multilevel-doubly-linked-list/submissions/1393377821)
- Great attempt but the downside was I had to iterate over the nodes of a level again when joining to it's higher level.

## Solutions
[Source](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-a-multilevel-doubly-linked-list/solutions/540211/c-iterative-preorder-traversal-solution-beats-96-runtime)
- Uses a `Stack` data structure
- The `next` node of each node is pushed on and popped of the stack each iteration and if the current node (not the `next` node) has a `child` node, then that is pushed onto the stack *after* the `next` node was pushed on.
- The next iteration then will pop the `child` node of the stack and start iterating at that level.
- When that level is finished (and there are no lower levels), the iteration starts back at the  original `next` node at the top level.
- This approach allows the last node of the bottom level to flow into the original next node at the top level.
