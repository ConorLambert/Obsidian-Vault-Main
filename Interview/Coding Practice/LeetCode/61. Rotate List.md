#### Steps
1. Iterates through the linked to find it's length
2. Join the end of the linked list to the current first item in the list
3. Find the index of the new head using the following modulo expression (NOTE that modulo has a higher priority than subtraction in expression evaluation) :
	`int newHeadIndex = listNum - k % listNum;`
4. Continue iterating the chain starting from where you left off which will loop back around to the current head (this is possible because we joined the first and last in step 2).
5. Iterate `newHeadIndex - 1` times
6. Update `head` to be `tail.next`
7. Set `tail.next` to null.
#### Notes
- We use modulo because sometimes the list is smaller than `k`
