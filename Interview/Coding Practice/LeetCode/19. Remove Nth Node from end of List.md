# Reflection
- In terms of the main part, we create a fast and slow pointer. The fast pointer will get a head start by iterating `n - 1` times through the list before stopping.
- Then the slow pointer and fast pointer will iterate together until the `next` reference of the fast pointer equals `null`.
- At this point, the slow pointer will point at the node *before* the node to be deleted.
- The slow pointer will then points its `next` reference to the `next.next` reference.
- Return `dummy.next`.
- The edge cases where a problem in this e.g. cases where list has one or two items.
- To get around this, create a dummy node as the initial node and makes it's next point at head.
- We start the iteration process from the dummy node and not head
