- Really clever solution 
- Create a list pointer for each `listA` and `listB`.
- Iterate through a while loop whilst `listA` pointer does not equal `listB` pointer.
- Each list pointer iterates through to the end of their respective lists at which point it will then continue its iteration starting at the head of the other list. So the `listA` pointer will continue iterating at the head of `listB` and vice-versa.
- This approach will result in both lists meeting at the intersection (if there is one) during the second iteration.
- If no intersection exists, then the second iteration will end in both list pointers pointing at `null` at the same time which satisfies the end of the while loop.
- In both successful and failed cases, we can just return one of either the `listA` or `listB` pointers because they will both point at the same value by the time the method ends, even if the value is `null`.
