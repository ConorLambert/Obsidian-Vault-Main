### What is .NET ?
- .NET is a platform that provides a comprehensive environment for building a wide range of cross-platform applications using various languages (including C#), libraries, and tools.
- It consists of several different components:
	- Runtime Environments
		- .NET Core
		- .NET Framework
		- Mono
	- Class Libraries
	- Base Class Library (BCL)
	- Common Language Runtime (CLR)
	- Frameworks and Tools
		- ASP.NET
		- Entity Framework
		- WinForms and WPF
		- Xamarin
		- .NET Standard
	- Languages
		- C#
		- F#
		- Visual Basic

### What is the .NET Framework
- *Windows only*
- This is the original version of the .NET platform, which is mostly used for building Windows only desktops and web applications. 
- It is still supported, but it is considered a legacy technology.

### What is .NET Core
- *Multiple operating systems*
- This is a cross-platform version of .NET that was introduced to overcome some limitations of the .NET Framework. 
- It is lightweight, fast, and suitable for building cross-platform applications that can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- It was completely rewritten from scratch

### What is .NET 5 (and beyond) ?
- Microsoft decided to simplify the naming and converge .NET Core and .NET Framework into a single platform called .NET 5. 
- .NET 5 and above is just .NET core version 5 and above. 
- 5 was chosen to be higher than both .NET core 3, and .NET framework 4.8. (there was no .NET core 4.X)
- This new platform is fully supported and is the recommended choice for new projects.

### What is ASP.NET ?
- ASP.NET is a web framework that sits on top of the .NET framework and is used to build dynamic web applications.

### What are the differences between ASP.NET and ASP ?
- ASP.NET 
	- Used to develop dynamic web applications
	- Uses .NET languages like C# and VB.NET
	- Compiled to MSIL
	- Fully OO
	- ADO.NET
- ASP
	- Used to create web pages
	- Uses the VBScript scripting language.
	- Interpreted during execution
	- Partially OO
	- ADO

### What is the .NET Standard ?
###### Answer
- This is a specification that defines a common set of APIs that can be used by .NET applications. 
- This makes it possible for the same code to run on many different .NET platforms, such as .NET Framework, .NET Core, and .NET 5 and beyond.
- For example, the Roslyn compiler is a .NET Standard 2.0 library, meaning that it can run on both .NET Framework 4.6.1+ and .NET Core 2.0+.
###### Explained
- There are various implementations of .NET (.NET Core, Mono, Xamarin, .NET Framework, etc). 
- Each implementation allows .NET code to execute in different places—Linux, macOS, Windows, iOS, Android, and many more. 
- .NET Standard then is a formal specification of the APIs that are common across all these .NET implementations.
- .NET Standard allows libraries to build against the agreed on set of common APIs, ensuring they can be used in any .NET application—mobile, desktop, IoT, web, or anywhere you write .NET code.
- .NET Standard is an in-between library that allows code to be shared between .NET Framework and .NET Core. In theory, if you compile code to .NET standard, it should be compatible with Framework and Core.
###### Explained Further
- .NET Framework, .NET Core and Mono for Xamarin all have different Base Class Libraries but all these BCLs follow common rules and regulations. 
- *Those rules and regulations are called .NET Standard.* 
- If a BCL follows these rules, then it is said to be *.NET Standard compliant*.
###### .NET 5 and later
- .NET 5 and later versions adopt a different approach to establishing uniformity that eliminates the need for .NET Standard in most scenarios.
- It is not a framework, it is a specification or set of rules.
###### Use Cases
- Use a .NET Standard library when you want to increase the number of applications that will be compatible with your library, and you are okay with a decrease in the .NET API surface area your library can access.

### What is the Common Language Runtime (CLR) ?
- A runtime environment that manages the execution of .NET programs, providing services like memory management, type safety, exception handling, garbage collection, and more.

### What are Class Libraries ?
- Class libraries are the [shared library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_%28computing%29#Shared_libraries) concept for .NET. 
- They enable developers to package useful functionality into modules that can be shared by multiple applications. 
- Some examples provided by .NET are the **Base Class Library** and **Framework Class Libraries** like ASP.NET.
- Class libraries are described using the **.NET Assembly file format**.
	- It's a project type in Visual Studio

### What are the Types of Class Libraries ?
- There are three types of class libraries that you can use:
	- **Platform-specific** class libraries have access to all the APIs in a given platform (for example, .NET Framework on Windows, Xamarin iOS), but can only be used by apps and libraries that target that platform.
	- **Portable** class libraries can be used by apps and libraries that target multiple platforms. They have access to a subset of APIs that are common across those targeted platforms.
	- **.NET Standard** class libraries are a merger of the **platform-specific** and **portable** library concept into a single model that provides the best of both.

### What is the Base Class Library (BCL) ?
- A core set of functionality (classes, interfaces, delegates and value types) that is used by all .NET applications.
- It provides a wide range of functionalities such as handling strings, collections, input/output operations, networking, security, threading and much more.
- BCL includes everything under the System namespace:
	- System.Collections
	- System.IO 
	- System.Text
	- System.Multithreading
- These classes form the foundation upon which more specialized functionality can be built.

### What is a Framework Class Library (FCL) ?
- The Framework Class Library is an extended collection of classes, types, and components built on top of the **Base Class Library**. 
- It provides higher-level functionality that is specific to certain application domains or industries. 
- The FCL includes classes for GUI (Graphical User Interface) development, web development, database access, networking, and more.
- Examples of FCL are ASP.NET for developing web applications and WPF which is used to render user interfaces.

### What is Mono ?
- An open-source implementation of the .NET Framework, primarily used for running .NET applications on macOS and Linux.

### What is Common Intermediate Language (CIL) ?
- A CPU and platform-independent *instruction set* that can be executed in any environment supporting the Common Language Runtime, such as the .NET runtime on Windows, or the cross-platform Mono runtime.
- When you write source code in languages that are compatible with the .NET ecosystem, such as C#, Visual Basic, or F#, the compilation process (done by Roslyn) converts this source code into Common Intermediate Language.
- This compiled code is stored in the form of an assembly file that has **.dll** or **.exe** extension.

### What is the JIT Compiler in .NET ?
- When a .NET application is run, a part of the CLR called the JIT Compiler takes the assembly file and translates the CIL code into native machine code that the underlying machine understands *whilst the application is running*.
- Where an application is compiled into CIL for later use, the JIT compiler is what executes when an application is actually run.
- This machine code can execute on the specific architecture of the computer it is running on.

### What is the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) ?
- An open specification and technical standard that describes how multiple high-level languages can be used on different computer platforms without being rewritten for specific architectures.
- Part of the specification defines the **CTS** and **CLS**.
- The specification defines how CLI compliant applications are compiled into **Intermediate Language**, which is further compiled into the target machine by the **Common Language Runtime** during execution. 

### What is the Common Type System (CTS) ?
- CTS defines how types are declared, used, and managed in the Common Language Runtime.
- It provides a library that contains the primitive data types (such as Boolean, Byte, Char, Int32, and UInt64) used in application development.
- It also defines rules that languages must follow, which helps ensure that objects written in different languages can interact with each other (CLS is responsible for this).
- More info in [[CTS]] note.

### What is the Common Language Specification (CLS) ?
- CLS is a subset of CTS and defines a set of rules and regulations to support inter-operability or cross-language integration so that code written in one CLS-compliant language can be used in another CLS-compliant language.
- It helps in reusing the code among all of the .NET-compatible languages.

### How can you differentiate .NET Core from ASP.NET Core ?
- .NET Core is a *runtime* and is used for the *execution* of an application that is built for it.
- ASP.NET Core is a collection of *libraries* that will form a *framework* for developing *web* applications.
