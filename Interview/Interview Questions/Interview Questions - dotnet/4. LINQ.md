### What is LINQ ?
- Language Integrated Query
- A set of features that extends query capabilities that allow data manipulation, *regardless of the data source*.

### What is deferred execution and immediate execution in LINQ ?
- Deferred execution means that the query is not executed at the time it is specified.
```c#
DataContext productContext = new DataContext();

var productQuery = from product in productContext.Products
        where product.Type == "SOAPS"
        select product;   // Query is NOT executed here

foreach (var product in productQuery)   // Query executes HERE
{
  Console.WriteLine(product.Name);
}
```
- Immediate execution is forced when the query is iterated over (as shown above) or when using a method such as `Average`, `Sum`, `Count`, `List`, `ToList`, or `ToArray`.

### What are extension methods in LINQ and how do you create them
- Extension methods enable you to "add" methods to existing types without creating a new derived type, recompiling, or otherwise modifying the original type.
- The following code example shows how to create an extension method called `Median` to compute a median for a sequence of numbers of type double
```c#
public static class EnumerableExtension
{
    public static double Median(this IEnumerable<double>? source)
    {
        // code here
        ...
    }
}
```
