# Big O
[Source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/big-o-notation-interview-questions-answers/)
### What is Big O notation ?
- Used to describe how an algorithms runtime increases as the input size increases.

### What are the rules of Big O notation ?
- [[Big O Notation#Rules|Rules]]

### What is O(1) ?
- The runtime of the algorithm remains constant regardless of the size of the input

### Can you please explain what O(n) means and provide an example ?
- The algorithms runtime increases proportionally with the size of the input.
- Iterating through an array

### Highlight the significance of O(log n) and when it is commonly utilized?
- Logarithmic time complexity
- `O(log n)` implies that as the input size grows the algorithms runtime increases slightly making it highly efficient for handling datasets

### What would be the runtime complexity when dealing with nested loops? How can we calculate it?
- O(n * m) where `n` represents the outer loop and `m` represents the inner loop.
