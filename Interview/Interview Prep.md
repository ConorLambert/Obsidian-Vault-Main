#### Weaknesses
- Not understanding the problem properly
	- Not properly reading the coding question
	- Not properly listening

##### I Don't Know:
- "I don't remember the exact constructs"
	- If you don't remember something like how MSMQ worked.

##### Things to Mention In Interview:
- I feel I am in a position to both fulfill my role and make the seniour engineers job easier (due to experience in Athora with UX upgrade project)
- I conducted interviews for other candidates.
- I continuously research new and existing technologies to enhance business processes within a company.
	- Also research more advanced features in technologies I already know
		- I like digging into documentation and see what features it can provide
			- This can generate new ideas.
- I want to understand the business and align my role with the business goals
	- If the best solution requires using an existing tool like Excel or some third party library, then use that instead of spending needless hours coding up an application.
- I strive to make other peoples lives easier in the company
- I want to help the team excel and not just myself (remember that 10x developer reddit [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1ep1sa9/what_makes_a_10x_or_whatever_your_term_is/))
- "That aspect of the solution is important, but it's not important at this moment in time in the project lifecycle"
	- The above is something to say in reference to devs spending needless time on features and functionality that isn't actually needed at that moment.
		- CSS styling.
		- Page load speed (provided the slow speed is not making the project unusable).
- Spend time (money) on developing unit tests rather then losing money because of a loss of customers because a bug showed up in production that caused downtime and lost trust.
- The goal of the new UI was hide away the things they don't generally need but make them accessible if they don't need them
	- ProductionSpecification

#### Features I'm proud off
- UX Upgrade
- InputsGrid

#### Questions to ask
- What hardware setup do you have
	- What are the desktop machines like?
