# Weaknesses
- Can have trouble saying "no".
- Difficulty delegating tasks.
- Not properly prioritizing tasks.

# I Don't Know:
- "I don't remember the exact constructs"

# Things to Mention In Interview:
#### Experience
- I conducted interviews for possible candidates.
#### Learning
- I continuously research new and existing technologies to enhance business processes within a company.
	- ARCSim
	- Angular
	- Mediator
	- VBA to streamline IFRS 17 process
- Understand more advanced features of existing technologies
- I like digging into documentation and see what features it can provide
#### Team Work
- I strive to make other peoples lives easier in the company
- I want to help the team excel and not just myself (remember that 10x developer reddit [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1ep1sa9/what_makes_a_10x_or_whatever_your_term_is/))
- Architect Elevator
	- Know how to talk to tech and non-tech people
- I feel I am in a position to both fulfil my role and make the senior engineers job easier (due to experience in Athora with UX upgrade project)
- I want to understand the business and align my role with the business goals
	- If the best solution requires using an existing tool like Excel or some third party library, then use that instead of spending needless hours coding up an application.
- "That aspect of the solution is important, but it's not important at this moment in time in the project lifecycle"
	- The above is something to say in reference to devs spending needless time on features and functionality that isn't actually needed at that moment.
		- CSS styling.
		- Page load speed (provided the slow speed is not making the project unusable).
- Code Reviews
	- 
#### UX
- The goal of the new UI was hide away the things they don't generally need but make them accessible if they don't need them
	- ProductionSpecification
- I like to observe how they use the current system so I can see any long steps they have to take. They are so use to performing the steps even when they are long but we can show a better way to do it.
### Planning
- Proposals
- Proof-of-concepts
#### Unit Testing
- Spend time (money) on developing unit tests rather then losing money because of a loss of customers because a bug showed up in production that caused downtime and lost trust.

# Features I'm proud off
- UX Upgrade
- InputsGrid

# Questions to ask
- What hardware setup do you have
	- What are the desktop machines like?
