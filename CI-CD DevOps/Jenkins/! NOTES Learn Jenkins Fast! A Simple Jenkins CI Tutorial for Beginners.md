### Difference between Jenkins build and Jenkins pipeline
[ChatGPT Source](https://chatgpt.com/c/66d8bca4-cd48-8012-acb9-c08d3dcd3aa8)
- **Build** is typically for single jobs
- **Pipeline** is typically for multiple builds that are chained together to achieve CI/CD.

### Relies heavily on external tools and plugins
- Jenkins relies on tools like Maven, Gradle, Git, etc to operate.
