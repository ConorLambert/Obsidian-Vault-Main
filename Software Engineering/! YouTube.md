##### Overview
- How to get management to build confidence in you.
- How to get them to notice you.
##### Notes
- Don't raise too much doubt about a project
	- If you see a lot of problems in a project, don't raise all at once
	- Raise one now, then another one much later on
	- You send the wrong message to management that their doing a bad job (even if your right).
- Repeat managements desires
	- Use the same language as them
		- Manager: "We want to benefit the customer"
		- Me: "I have this new feature that will benefit the customer"
- Anonymise blame
	- If there is something wrong with the production environment and management is asking what is wrong, *don't* say "The production team has not setup the environment properly". Instead say "There seems to be a problem with production environment". And if it goes further and they ask "Why is their a problem with the production environment", then say, "Well I am not responsible for the production environment".
	- *Let management come to their own conclusions.*
- Reduce your throughput
	- Produce less
	- Deliver less 
	- Commit to less 
	- Don't slack off or not care about the project
	- Delay commitments because unexpected things happen.
		- The task(s) you are assigned could have had something in it that is unforeseen or that needs to be further researched.
	- Minimize the things that your on the hook for to give yourself flexibility.
- Elevate your coworkers
	- Let other people know the good work they are doing
	- Congratulate your team mates on hard things they did.
	- If a junior helped you fixed something, thank and acknowledge them.
	- Talk publicly about the good work other people are doing
	- Someone might not want to promote you if they think you are going to compete against them.
- Raise awareness of times you made progress faster.
	- Memory leak that you thought was going to take a week to research and solve but then you found a tool that can solve it for us in just a day
	- "I have found a tool which is going to save *us* 4 days", they keyword is *us* in that sentence
- Document verbal decisions
	- You find a big problem and you highlight it to higher ups or the architect and they still aren't persuaded. Then document this interaction. Draft an email:
		- "FYI: Conclusions of our meeting today: Good meeting with you today. I do understand were not going to deal with the failed database backup".
		- Forward the email when the shit hits the fan. Be nice about it:
			- "Here is the decision that was made. I am happy to help us get back on track"

## The difference between you and ThePrimeagen.

- Having a real thirst for knowledge
	- Learning new languages and technologies
- Studies show that breaking a number of tasks down into manageable chunks and completing them can have a positive dopamine effect.
- Really believe that you can do something.
- The more you struggle, the more you will learn
	- Whether the end result is good or not, the experience that you will get from taking on this challenge will far outweigh any negatives that you might come across.
## Immutable Design: Why You Should Care

- Immutability is *not only* when you request a new object upon every change. 
	- Immutable design is a separate strategy
- *"A large fraction of the flaws in software development are due to programmers not fully understanding all the possible states their code can execute in"* - John Carmack.

##### Overview
- Get to the root of what your client wants
- What is it that they actually want at the root level.
- What is the problem they are running into.
- Understand the why of writing the code that your writing
- You may understand the high-level overview of what your client wants but the reason for the individual features your implementing is still unclear. 
- They don't know there is better ways to do what they actually want deep down. 
-  The XY problem
	- "It occurs when someone seeking help focuses on their attempted solution (X) rather than the actual problem they're trying to solve (Y)"
- Understand which part of your customer's business process your software implements. Don't just be a programmer, be a problem solver.
- Question and challenge your business team, because most of the time they don't know what they need.
- As Henry Ford (might have) said: *"If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses."*
##### How to Improve your Skill
- Really understand the domain.
- In terms of clients, get as close to the source as possible. Not the project lead but maybe the accountant/actuary etc your solving the problem for.
- If there is a lot steps on what to do and not why to do it then go back and ask the relevant people. 
	- Why is this button needed for example.
		- You may have something on another page that already does it.
