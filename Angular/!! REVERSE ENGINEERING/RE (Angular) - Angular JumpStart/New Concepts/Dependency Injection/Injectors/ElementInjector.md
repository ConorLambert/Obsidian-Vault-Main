- Specialised injector that inherits from the root [[Injector]] class.
- Designed to [[Provider|provide]] dependencies to components and directives within a specific DOM element.
- An `ElementInjector` is empty by default unless you configure it in the `providers` property on `@Directive()` or `@Component()`.
- Components and directives on the same element share an injector.
