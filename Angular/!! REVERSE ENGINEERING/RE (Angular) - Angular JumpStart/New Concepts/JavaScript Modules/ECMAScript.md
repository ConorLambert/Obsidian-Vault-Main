#### Overview
- ECMAScript is a scripting-language *specification* created by the **European Computer Manufacturers Association** (ECMA) but later adopted by **World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)**.
- The specification ensures the interoperability of JavaScript across different web browsers.

#### ECMAScript vs JavaScript
- ECMAScript is a specification that defines what a scripting language should look like, while JavaScript is an actual implementation of that specification.
- ECMAScript is a standard that all implementations of JavaScript must follow. 
- Any browser or engine that implements JavaScript must adhere to this standard. 
- This ensures that all implementations are consistent and compatible with each other.
