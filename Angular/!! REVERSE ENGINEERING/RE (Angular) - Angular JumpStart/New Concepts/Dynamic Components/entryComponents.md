- Used for dynamically added components
- Offline template compiler (OTC) only builds components that are actually used. 
- If components aren't used in templates directly the OTC can't know whether they need to be compiled. 
- Adding them to `entryComponents` tells the OTC to compile them and create [[Component Factory|factories]] for them.
