This proposes a set of steps or questions that the developer should go through when implementing some part of an Angular application.

For example, think of a situation when trying to decide what approach to use for `ngClass`. 
You may ask the following questions:
1. Is the condition complex
	- This would rule out inline-expressions
2. Are there multiple classes to apply
3. ???

Another example is what lifecycle hook a piece a logic should be placed into.
