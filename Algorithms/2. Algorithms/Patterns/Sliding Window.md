- Slide the window along the array element by element *but keep track of what the total of the last window was*.

### Collection Conditions
- NAN

### Time Complexity
- O(n)
- An improvement from the naive approach which O(n * k) where k is the window length.

### Space Complexity
- O(1)
- Fixed-size window and a few additional variables to perform calculations or store intermediate results.

### Use Cases
- Finding subarrays with a specific sum. 
- Finding the longest substring with unique characters
- Solving problems that require a fixed-size window to process elements efficiently
