### Overview
- Similar to [[Two Pointer Algorithm]]
- Moves two pointers at different speeds
- Slow pointer increments one at a time, the fast pointer increments two at a time.
- Once the slow pointer enters the cycle (if one exists), the fast pointer will meet the slow pointer in the same loop.

### Use Cases
- Finding cycles in LinkedLists and Arrays.
- Finding middle node in a Linked List.

### Implementation
- ???

### Complexity
##### Time Complexity
- O(n)
##### Space Complexity
- O(1)
