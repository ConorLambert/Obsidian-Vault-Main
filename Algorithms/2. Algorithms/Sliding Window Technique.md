### Explained
- StackOverflow [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8269916/what-is-sliding-window-algorithm-examples).

### Collection Conditions
- NAN

### Time Complexity
- O(n)
- An improvement from the naive approach which O(n * k) where k is the window length.

### Space Complexity
- O(1)
- Fixed-size window and a few additional variables to perform calculations or store intermediate results.

### Use Cases
- Finding subarrays with a specific sum. 
- Finding the longest substring with unique characters
- Solving problems that require a fixed-size window to process elements efficiently

### Comments
- More of a technique than an algorithm.
- Can be employed in various situations.

### Code Example
