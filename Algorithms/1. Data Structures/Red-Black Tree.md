## Overview
- A [[binary search tree]] is a fundamental data structure, but their performance can suffer if the tree becomes unbalanced.
- Red-black trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree.
- Uses a set of rules to ensure logarithmic time complexity for operations regardless of the initial shape of the tree.
- Each node has an additional attribute: a color, which can be either red or black.

### Properties of Red-Black Trees
These properties ensure that the longest path from the root to any leaf is no more than twice as long as the shortest path, maintaining the treeâ€™s balance and efficient performance:
1. **Node Color:** Each node is either red or black.
2. **Root Property:** The root of the tree is always black.
3. **Red Property:** Red nodes cannot have red children (no two consecutive red nodes on any path).
4. **Black Property:** Every path from a node to its descendant null nodes (leaves) has the same number of black nodes.
5. **Leaf Property:** All leaves (NIL nodes) are black.

## Rotations

##### Overview
- Fundamental operation to maintain balance
- Remember the right subtree holds the bigger values and the left subtree holds the smaller values.
	- *Rotation will still maintain this*
- Occurs after Insertion and Deletion operations
##### Left Rotation
- ???
##### Right Rotation
- ???

## Operations
- Insertion
	- Same as [[binary search tree]] but with added rotation
- Deletion
	- Same as [[binary search tree]] but with added rotation
- Searching
	- Same as [[binary search tree]]

## Use Cases
- `SortedDictionary<K,V>`

## Time Complexity
- O(log n) -> Insertion, Deletion, Search
- O(1) -> Rotation
	- Only changing a few pointers in the tree

## Space Complexity
- O(n)
	- Only require additional storage bit for color

## Weaknesses
- ???
