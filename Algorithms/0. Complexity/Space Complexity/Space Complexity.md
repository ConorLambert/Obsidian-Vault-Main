- Space complexity is concerned with how an algorithms memory space increases as the input size increases.
- This [article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dsa-mastery-understanding-space-complexity-beginners-manish-v--3yozf/) pretty much covers everything:
	- Step by step approach to calculating space complexity
	- Great examples
