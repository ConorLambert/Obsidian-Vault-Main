### Basics
1. What is it ? (definitions)
2. How it's represented ? (array, linked)
3. Different operations you can perform on it (inserting a node, deleting a node)
4. Time/space complexities (O(n), O(log n))

### Learn Real World Applications
- Google Maps uses graph data structure and shorted path algorithm like Dijkstra.
- Makes you understand how important the algorithm is.

### Implement from Scratch
- Code it out from scratch using your favourite programming language
- When learning about stacks, implement them using arrays and linked lists.

### Learn In-Built Libraries
- Know all the different collections available in your programming language.

### Solve Easy Problems
- Find LeetCode questions on the algorithm and solve them
