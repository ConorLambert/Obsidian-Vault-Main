- Take a screenshot of the page you will be building and paste this into some image software like MS paint
	- Use the paint tool as a scratch pad to make notes and drawing over the page
- We are looking for patterns/consistencies where possible. 
	- We can start to build utility classes that represent these patterns and then apply them to the relevent parts of the page.
- See what typography styles are used through out the page 
	- Fonts (there could be more than one used)
	- Sizes
		- Use the tool to mark text as H1 , H2, etc
	- Weight
- See what (if any) repeating layout patterns exist. 
	- Use the paint tool to write down how it works (Centered, Flexbox, Grid, etc)
- See what wrapper/containers will be needed (if any) for the different sections. 
	- Trying to avoid unecessary wrapper/container elements
- Look at the smaller details
	- How will a section work internally
		- Flexbox or Grid, etc
- See the unique aspects of the page i.e. maybe one piece of text has its own size that no other piece of text has.
